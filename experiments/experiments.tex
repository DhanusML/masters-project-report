\section{Experiments}
All the algorithms mentioned in the previous chapter were implemented
using python. The stopping criterion for the algorithms were
$\hbox{RG}<10^{-4}$. The algorithms were run on different networks:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Anaheim
	\item Chicago Sketch
	\item Eastern Massachusetts
	\item Sioux Falls
\end{itemize}

Details of the networks are given in table \ref{table:networksdim}
\input{experiments/netdim-table.tex}


\section{Results}
The run time of the algorithm, is recorded for all four networks.
The Relative Gap after each iteration is also recorded for the algorithms.
Results are given in table \ref{table:resulttable}. The Relativity Gap
against number of iterations plot is given in figure \ref{plots}.

\section{Conclusions}
From the experimental data, the greedy algorithm clearly outperforms
other algorithms.
But for large networks the current implementation
failed to give results within reasonable amount of time.
A more efficient implementation using a faster language would
solve this.
