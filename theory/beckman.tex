The Beckman formulation gives a convex function whose minimizers
are the equillibrium path flow (or link flow) solutions
of the traffic equillibrium problem.

For a given link flow $x_{ij}$ for $i,j\in A$, the Beckman function
is defined as

\begin{equation}\label{beck}
	\sum_{i,j\in A}\int_{0}^{x_{ij}}t_{ij}(\omega)d\omega
\end{equation}

Under a mild assumption that the link travel times 
are increasing functions of the corresponding link flows,
the Beckman function is convex. % insert reference to appendix or
								% some other section here
The flow constraints on the link flows are
\[
	\sum_{p\in P_{rs}}y_p = d_{rs}
\]
