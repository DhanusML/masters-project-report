\begin{definition}[Wardrop Equillibrium]
For a given origin-destination pair, all used paths between
them must have equal and minimal travel time.
\end{definition}

The definition states that if passenger $A$ is travelling from
$r$ to $s$ along a path $P$ with travel time $\tau$, then any
other passenger $B$ travelling from $r$ to $s$ along some path $P'$
with travel time $\tau'$ must satisfy $\tau=\tau'$ and there must
not be any unused path between $r$ and $s$ that has travel time less
than $\tau$.
