\begin{definition}
	A set $X\subseteq \R^n$ is convex if for $x,y\in X$,
	$\lambda x + (1-\lambda)y \in X$ for every $\lambda \in [0,1]$.
\end{definition}


\begin{definition}
	A function $f:X\rightarrow \R$, where $X\subseteq \R^n$ is
	convex if for any $x,y\in X$,
	\[
		f(\lambda x + (1-\lambda)y) \leq \lambda f(x) + (1-\lambda)f(y)
	\]
	for every $\lambda \in [0,1]$.
\end{definition}


A few well known results about convex sets and
convex functions are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Unions and intersections of convex sets are convex.

	\item A differentiable function is convex if and only if
	\[
		f(y)\geq f(x) + \nabla f(x)^T (y-x)\quad \forall x,y\in X
	\]

	\item A twice differentiable function is convex if and only if
	its Hessian is positive semi-definite at every point in its
	domain.

	\item If $f$ is a convex function, then the set
	\[
		\{x\in X: a< f(x) < b\}\subseteq \R^n
	\]
	is convex for $a,b\in \R\cup\{\infty,-\infty\}$ (also true
	for $<$ replaced with $\leq$).

	\item If $f:\R\rightarrow \R$ is a non-decreasing function,
	then the function
	\[
		g(x) = \int_{0}^x f(t)dt
	\]
	is a convex function.

	\item If a differentiable function $f$ is convex in $\R^n$,
	then $f$ has a unique minima in $X$, which is attained at points
	where $\nabla f = 0$.
\end{enumerate}
