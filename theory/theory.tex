The goal of this chapter is to  frame the traffic equillibrium problem
as a convex program. But before that, we will go through the basics of
convex optimization problems in general and give a few
results about it.


\section{Basics of Convex Optimization}


\section{Wardrop Equillibria and Beckman Formulation}
	Before we can model the equillibrium in traffic network, we need
	to first properly define the notion of equillibrium. We would also
	want the definition to be easily translatable into a series of
	equations. The following sections give a definition and
	formulates the equillibrium condition as solution of a
	convex optimization problem.
