Frank Wolfe Algorithm is similar to MSA. The link flows are
updated by taking convex combination of the current flow solution
with the all or nothing flow solution. The only difference is
in the choice of the coefficient used in the convex combination.
In Frank Wolfe, the algorithm \ref{alg:bisection} (BISECTION) is
used to obtain a coefficient in each iteration. This function returns
the coefficient for which, the convex combination attains minimum
value of Beckman function. This ensures the best possible descent
in each iteration. The pseudocode for Frank Wolfe algorithm is given
in algorith \ref{alg:fw}.
