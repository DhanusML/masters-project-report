In MSA, the link flows in the next iteration is obtained by taking
the convex combination of the current link flow vector with
the all or nothing link flow solution. The coefficient for
convex combination is the inverse of the iteration number.
This makes sure that the flow vector lies inside the feasible region,
since the feasible region is a convex set.
The pseudocode for MSA is given in algorithm \ref{alg:msa}.
