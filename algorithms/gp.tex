In Gradient Projection method, the path flows are updated by moving
the current path flow solution in the direction of the gradient of the
Beckman function and then projecting the resulting vector back to
the feasible region. The pseudocode for Gradient Projection is
given in algorithm \ref{alg:gp}.
